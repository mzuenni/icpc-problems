            \begin{itemize}
                \item Determine the \emph{convincingness} of each of $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$ suspects.
                \item For every suspect, you know the time at which they arrived
                    at the scene and the duration they stayed
                ($1 \leq a,t \leq 10^9$).
                \item A suspect $A$ provides an alibi for suspect $B$ if and only if
                $A$ was in the room for the entire duration $B$ was in there.
                \item A suspect without an alibi has convincingness $0$.
                Otherwise, their convincingness is $1$ more than the convincingness of the most convincing suspect
                who provides them with an alibi.
