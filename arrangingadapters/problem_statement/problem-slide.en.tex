  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given $1\leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5$ chargers, each $3\leq w\leq
    10^9\,\textrm{cm}$ wide, how many fit into a powerstrip
    comprising a row of $1\leq s\leq 10^5$ sockets, each of width $3\,\textrm{cm}$?
  \item Every charger has the plug at the end, and may be roted by $180^\circ$ before plugging in.
  \item Chargers may extend outwards and touch, but may not overlap.
  \end{itemize}

  The first six chargers can be plugged in as shown, but it is impossible
  to plug in all seven chargers simultaneously.
