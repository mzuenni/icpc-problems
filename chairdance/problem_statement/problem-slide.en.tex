            \begin{itemize}
                \item Simulate deterministic a game of \emph{Musical Chairs}.
                \item $2\leq n\leq 5\cdot 10^5$ players are sitting on as many
                  chairs arranged in a circle numbered modulo $n$.
                \item The game master gives three types of commands:
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item ``\texttt{+~$x$}'': The player on chair~$i$ moves to chair~$i+x$.
                    \item ``\texttt{*~$x$}'': The player on chair~$i$ moves to chair~$i\cdot{}x$.
                    \item ``\texttt{?~$x$}'': Tell us the number of the player on chair~$x$.
                  \end{itemize}
                \item  When multiple players go to the same
                      chair, the one moving the shortest distance in clockwise
                      direction gets it. The others are out.
                \item Simulate up to $5\cdot 10^5$ commands and answer the query commands
                  (answering $-1$ if the chair is empty).
            \end{itemize}

          \small Sample Input 1 at the fourth command. Players~$4$~and~$10$ both need to move to chair~$2$.
          Player~$10$ needs to travel less, so gets to take the seat. Player~$4$ is out.
