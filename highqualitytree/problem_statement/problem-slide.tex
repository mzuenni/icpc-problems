    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine the minimum number of \emph{robberies} to make a binary
            tree \emph{strongly balanced}.
        \item A robbery is to take a leaf and remove it, and doing so may turn its parent vertex into a leaf.
        \item A tree is strongly balanced when for each vertex the height of its
            left and right subtree differs by at most $1$.
        \item The tree has $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$ vertices.
    \end{itemize}
