    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine whether it is possible to hit all rooms in a spaceship with a single, infinite-length beam.
        \item The spaceship is represented by a set of $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
        axis-aligned non-intersecting rectangles (${0\leq x_1<x_2\leq10^9}$ and ${0\leq y_1<y_2\leq10^9}$).
    \end{itemize}

    The hull beam in red hits all rooms and is the only valid solution in this case.
