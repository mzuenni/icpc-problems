    \begin{block}{Problem}
        Simulate how a multi-level fountain fills up as liquid is poured into levels multiple times.
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Naive solution}
        Just do it, iterating to find next level each time while some poured amount remains.
        Run time: $\mathcal O(qn)$, too slow!
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Solution}
        We need to find the Next Greater Element (NGE) for each index.
        Can be done with one linear pass and a stack.
        Use Union-Find with path compression to track where overflow ends up.
        When level $i$ fills up, unite $i$ with $\mathrm{NGE}(i)$.
        Run time: $\mathcal O(n + q\alpha(n))$.
