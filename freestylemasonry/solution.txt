Solution:
Notice that if there is a solution there is also onewhere
you first place some bricks upwards and then fill up the
wall with horizontal bricks. It is also optimal to go from
left to right and place as many bricks upwards as possible.

If we do this we are always left with the top most rows
already filled in an alternating fashion (from the
horizontal bricks placed in the previous column) and some
free space. We then fill the free space with as many
bricks as possible (leaving at most one place free)
If the free area would be negative then no solution exists.
Finally w add in all the holes sidewards bricks. This either
decreases or increases the length of the alternating part
by one. Thus it is sufficient to to keep track of the
size of the alternating sequence.
